                I am about 25% nerd, 25% fun lover, and 50% goofball; however, dog mom is my main career, and I
                have a
                malamute husky mix. His name is Barry, after Barry Allen the Flash. He is full of so much energy,
                and
                is
                always wanting my attention. It can be aggrivating, but I love him. He is the reason I became a dog
                handler
                at a dog hotel. We both love it there, and we have made so many friendships with all the dogs. We
                even
                have
                our favorites.

                I also love super hero's, video games, and anime. I feel super heros's and anime have impacted so
                much
                on
                me. They are constantly fighting huge conflicts involving morality, and I have been exposed to
                these
                stories most of my adolecent life. That is why I feel they impacted me, because I believe they
                helped
                me
                evolve and understand my own beliefs. Video games have helped me enjoy problem solving, and grow a
                love
                and
                hate relationship with persistance. On one hand I will not give up on a puzzle no matter how many
                times
                I
                reset it, but on another it feels like I am in purgatory resetting an unsolvable problem. Despite
                that
                I
                will always enjoy the different lives, adventures, and lessons. I get to experience this all from
                my
                bedroom on a screen, and to me that seems like wizardry.
